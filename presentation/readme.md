## Point of Sales System


1. Sales
	* Track sales

		+ Did items expire without selling
	* What do we expect to sell in the next week?
	* Should we run a sale before a large number of items expire?
	* What are customers buying together?

2. Receiving Products
	* Track what we are buying
	* Should we stop buying as much from a distributor
	* is there something we are not buying that we should consider

3. Inventory
